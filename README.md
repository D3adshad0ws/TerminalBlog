A complex ***proof-of-concept*** (React/Postgres) application to make blog(s) more engaging. 

Features:

- 1. 


blogs and  designed in less than 30min using
Replit. The domain might be go down by now (Replit offered to host but I am not paying $20 a month
for something I can do myself). 



on the native macOS xterm-256 "Homebrew" theme.

>   one of my favorite developement 


one of the first front end environments I have 

https://github.com/yourusername/terminal-blog.git
cd terminal-blog

Note that there is an "admin" user with a predefined password. If anyone decides to self host, I strongly suggest you change the password to something unique. As a security centric blog hopefully that goes without saying :)
