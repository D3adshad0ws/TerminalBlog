git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terminal-blog.git
cd terminal-blog

## Note that there is an "admin" user with a predefined password. If anyone decides to self host, I strong suggest you change the password first to something unique. Afterall, this is a security centric blog so hopefully that goes without saying :)
